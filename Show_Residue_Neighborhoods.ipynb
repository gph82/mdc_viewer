    "1. **Load the GUI and the data** \n",
    "   * Click anywhere on the cell below and then on the \"> Run\" button above\n",
    "   * You should see a progress bar (scroll to the bottom of the page)\n",
    "   * Loading takes some time, but only initially\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "2. **Residue Selection**: Pick from the list or enter manually\n",
    "   * Expressions with ranges and wildcards are allowed, like:\n",
    "    - GLU*, R131,R385-L394\n",
    "   * Hit *preview* to see what your selection finds\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "3. **General options**: Can be ignored in the first run and used afterwards.\n",
    "   * The plots will update automatically when you change the general options.\n",
    "   * Toggle *Per-Figure-Options* to control each plot individually\n",
    "       * This crowds the output a bit\n",
    "       * The general options still have effect, so if you change those you'll loose individual changes         \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "4. **Output**: Hit the green button and bar-plots representing the residue neighborhoods will appear. \n",
    "    * Control the distance cutoff of the neighborhood with the slider bar\n",
    "    * If your selection did not work, you will see text instead of figures\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Save**: Save any figure by right-clicking on it\n",
    "    * For now you have to use your browsers's *Save Image As*-option\n",
    "    * A normal \"save\" button will be there in the next versions\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Help**: Hover with your mouse over the options and find out more\n",
